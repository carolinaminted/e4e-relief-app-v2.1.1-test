# Claude AI Integration Guide

This document outlines the potential integration points and considerations for using Anthropic's Claude AI models within the E4E Relief application. This is a placeholder document for future exploration.

## 1. Potential Use Cases

- **Enhanced AI Assistant:** Claude's larger context window and strong reasoning capabilities could be used for more complex, multi-turn conversations in the AI Relief Assistant.
- **Document Analysis:** Claude could be used to analyze uploaded documents (receipts, official letters) to extract key information and validate expenses.
- **Application Summarization:** For admin review, Claude could generate concise summaries of complex application narratives.

## 2. API Considerations

- Integration would require a separate SDK or direct API calls to Anthropic's services.
- API key management and cost tracking would need to be implemented separately from the existing Gemini integration.

## 3. Next Steps

- [ ] Obtain Claude API access for development.
- [ ] Create a feature branch to prototype a Claude-powered feature.
- [ ] Evaluate performance and cost against the current Gemini implementation.
